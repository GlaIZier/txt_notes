By defaults regexp use Greedy algorithm to find substrings, so it finds the biggest possible substring. E.g. "([\S\s]+)(num)" in the string "123num 435num 643num" group1 123num 435num 643 and group2 num.
To enable lazy (to find as few times as possible) you can specify flag /U - this means ungreedy. or u can add "?"" after the plus like this: "([\S\s]+?)(num)" so it will find group1 - 123, group2 - num; group1 - 435, group2 - num


To find substrings in the regexp use (). This means groups. To replace in editor or in ide u can get a ling to different group using $ and number of a group. Eg, $3
